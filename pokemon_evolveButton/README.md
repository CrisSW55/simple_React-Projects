# Practicing using React by using useState, pokemon as my objects, and buttons to evolve the pokemon in an array of pokemon objects, containing there types,id,pokemonName,and their image
# This will better improve my useState and React in general coding/writing skills by creating
# this fun project displaying the pokemon being evolved when button gets clicked!!!
# Images are not mine, this is only for learning purpose, I do not own the images
# Created an imageList.js file to import all the pokemon images into that file then created
# an export image list, so that the images can be better accessed and App.js has cleaner/readable   # code
